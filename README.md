# API-Lab-Group-3
# The group decided to work with http://dynamicsjs.com

# dynamics.js allows us to create physics based animations with the built in functionality. We have explored the possibilitys of the framework by manipulating existing examples. Example 2 shows how to animante and svg path but you can animate any JavaScript object. Below is an example of how to animate an object.

# var o = {
#  number: 10,
#  color: #"FFFFF",
#  string: "10deg",
#  array: [ 1, 10 ]
# }
# dynamics.animate (o, {
#  number: 20,
#  color: "#000000",
#  string "90deg",
#  array: [ -9, 99 ]
#  })

# Once you have you have your variable and objecs down you can set a default animation type or simply create one with the built in parameters, friction, duration, delay and many more following the syntax "dynamics.animate(variable, properties, options)".

# Creating physics based animations can be usefull in a many areas. Not only does it make your design feel more alive but it grabs the users attention and your animated object stands out from the croud. Implementing any animation into a website makes it look more professional and the fact that it's based on physics makes it natural to look at and possibly interact with.

# what are we exploring? not sure how to elaborate on that.

# In order to try it out for yourself, visit http://dynamicsjs.com and follow the instructions or download this github repository and try out our examples yourself.

# This project was made by Patrik Svensson, Richard Modecir Soto, Anton Forsell and Caleb Oyegun as a way to explore different librarys. The repository will not be maintained.
