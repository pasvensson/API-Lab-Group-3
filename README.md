# API-Lab-Group-3 "Team Dynamics"
# We worked with http://dynamicsjs.com

# dynamics.js has built-in tools that allow us to create physics-based animations. We have explored the possibilities of the framework by manipulating existing examples.

# Example 2 shows how to animate an SVG path but you can animate any JavaScript object. Below is an example of how to animate an object:

# var o = {
#  number: 10,
#  color: #"FFFFF",
#  string: "10deg",
#  array: [ 1, 10 ]
# }
# dynamics.animate (o, {
#  number: 20,
#  color: "#000000",
#  string "90deg",
#  array: [ -9, 99 ]
#  })

# Once you have your variable and objects down, you can set a default animation type or simply create one with the built-in parameters: friction, duration, delay and many more; following the syntax "dynamics.animate(variable, properties, options)".

# Creating physics-based animations can be useful in a many areas. Not only does it make your design feel more alive, but it also grabs the users' attention and your animated object stands out from the crowd. Implementing any animation into a website makes it look more professional and the fact that it's based on physics makes it natural to look at and possibly even to interact with.

# what are we exploring? not sure how to elaborate on that.

# In order to try it out for yourself, visit http://dynamicsjs.com and follow the instructions or download this GitHub repository and try out our examples yourself.


# This project was made by Patrik Svensson, Richard Modecir, Anton Forsell and Caleb Oyegun as a way to explore a JS library. We have no plans of maintaining this repository.
